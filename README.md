# 100-Days-of-Code-Python-Pro-Bootcamp

## Why I take this bootcamp?
- I can have a clear goal when learning - certificate
- It provides me a lot of interesting projects which can let me apply what I learn and have something to showcase when I complete the course
- I want to integrate and revised what I learnt pieces by pieces before and make my knowledge and skills well-rounded
- I can learn the best practices from professionals
- I want to have a deeper understanding about coding and learn how to explain

## My progression so far ......

### Error types I learnt
1. Syntax error
2. Name error - variable name undefined
3. Logic error
4. Type error
5. TabError - inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
6. IndentationError - unindent does not match any outer indentation level
7. Value error
8. Index error - list index out of range
9. Key error - key not exist in dictionary
10. Unbound local error

### Debugging tips
1. describe the problem
- what is the code doing
- when is the code meant to do something
- try to make assumptions about the output and value of variable

2. reproduce the bug
- know when and why bug occur 
- change the code so that the code always produce that error
make the scenario consistent and same to ease the process of debugging

3. play computer
- imagine and predict what happens for each line of code
- follow the logic, evaluate the condition line by line, visualize the condition in ur head

4. fix the error
- read and understand the error messages output in console or highlighted by code editor - get clue from them
- copy and search the error on Internet to find others' solutions

5. print is your friend
- print the value of variables involved to know which part of the code produce error

6. use a debugger
- help to visualize the execution of code
- help to simplify the complex scenario and let us understand te condition

7. take a break
- have a rest/ go sleep -> make ur brain fresh
- starring the screen doesn't give u answer

8. ask a friend/ mentor
-  won't make assumtion u made and will have a different and fresh view point about the problem

9. run often
- run the code after every little updates
- dont let the bugs accumulate -> problem will get more complex

10. ask stackoverflow
- get advices from experienced professionals

### Coding tips
1. breakdown the big problem into small problems
2. make a to-do list and start with the easiest
3. turn problem statement into comments
4. write code, run code and debug
5. tackle next task
